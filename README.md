QuikUse Scientific Calulator
This code creates a simple web-based scientific calculator with buttons for digits, basic arithmetic operations, and some common scientific functions like square root, sine, cosine, and tangent. It uses the eval function to evaluate the expression entered by the user and display the result. Note that using eval can be potentially unsafe if not used carefully.
